# Loops

Loops is a project that has two different aplications, one of them will ask you for a number from 1 to 100 to try your luck and will tell you wether the random number is lower, greater or if it's the correct number, as well it will tell you
how many attempts were done to guess the number. On the other hand, the second aplication is divided by different activities that you can do. It will lead you to a menu where you can choose 5 options to execute. 

The first will be about Laura a newspaper seller and will tell you how many newspapers she will sell, how many energy she has and how many newspaper she sells, for each newspaper sold she will get -5% of energy, at the end will tell you 
wether she sold or not all the newspapers.

The second aplication will ask you for a number and will count from lowest to higest, the third one will ask you as well for a number but in this case will count from higest to lowest. 

The fourth one will ask you as well for a number and it will print a triangle with asterisks until the number of asterisks turns into the number that you entered.

The fifth one will be divided in 2, you can either get a tree by the maximum symbols you want or by the maximum lines that you want to print.
